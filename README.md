üîß Streamlit CRUD App (SQLite Version)

This is a simple, fully functional Streamlit web app for performing:
	‚Ä¢	CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
	‚Ä¢	A real-world SQL transaction: transferring values between rows using safe, rollback-enabled logic

It uses a SQLite database and is designed for educational use, ideal for learning database logic and deploying on Streamlit Community Cloud.

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Guide (For Students)

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Run the App Locally First

Before deploying anything, get it working on your own machine.

#### üß∞ Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

#### üîß Setup Instructions:

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open a terminal in the repo folder
3. Run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

Explore the sample app with preloaded users (`Alice`, `Bob`, `Charlie`). Try adding, editing, deleting users, and transferring age.

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Step 2: Deploy the Working Example to the Cloud

After running locally and confirming it works:

1. Push your copy of this repo to GitHub
2. Visit: [https://streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
3. Log in and click **"New app"**
4. Connect your GitHub repo
5. Click **Deploy**

üéâ You now have a live CRUD app running with:
- A sample SQLite DB (`database.sqlite`)
- Features:
  - Add, edit, delete users
  - Transfer age between users (see Step 4)

---

### üîç Step 3: Explore the Sample App

Open your deployed app in the browser and try the following:

- Add a new user
- Edit an existing user's name or age
- Delete someone from the list
- Use **"Transfer Age Between Users"** to shift age values around

This gives you a feel for how the app works before using your own data.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Update Config for Your Own Table

When you're ready to use your own database:

1. Open `config.py` and update:
   - `DB_PATH` to your new `.sqlite` file name
   - `TABLE_NAME` to match your own table
   - `COLUMNS` with the field names (excluding `id`)

2. Replace `database.sqlite` with your exported version.

---

### üîÑ Step 5: Export Your MySQL DB to SQLite

Use a tool like DB Browser for SQLite, or try this approach:

```bash
# Export MySQL to SQL
mysqldump -u your_user -p your_db > dump.sql

# Convert SQL to SQLite (optional method)
pip install sqlite-utils
sqlite-utils convert dump.sql database.sqlite
```

Once your new `.sqlite` file is in place, commit the change to GitHub ‚Äî your deployed app will automatically update.

---

### üîÅ Step 6: Test the "Transfer Age" Transaction

Once your app is running, scroll to the section titled:

> **"Transfer Age Between Users (Transactional)"**

#### What It Does:
- Transfers a specified number of "age years" from one user to another.
- Both updates occur in a **single transaction** ‚Äî if anything fails, nothing is changed.

#### ‚úÖ To Try It:
1. Select a user in the **"From (User ID)"** dropdown.
2. Select a different user in the **"To (User ID)"** dropdown.
3. Enter an age value to transfer (e.g. `2`).
4. Click **"Transfer Age"**.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases:
- If the **"from" user** doesn‚Äôt have enough age, the transaction fails.
- Selecting the same user for both fields is prevented.
- Errors are displayed clearly, and the DB rolls back automatically.

## üì¨ For Educators

This template is meant for:
- Class projects
- Assignments with database components
- Lightweight app demos with local DBs

‚ö†Ô∏è Heads-up: When deployed to Streamlit Cloud, your data won‚Äôt persist between app restarts or redeploys.
This is because the app reloads the original database file from GitHub each time.

‚úÖ If you want to keep your data:
	‚Ä¢	Run the app locally (streamlit run streamlit_app.py)
	‚Ä¢	Or use a cloud-hosted database (like Supabase or MySQL)
